  <h1>Taco Recipe</h1>
  <p><strong>Step 1</strong>
    In a food processor or blender, blend cilantro, chipotle chile, adobo sauce, scallions, garlic, lime zest, lime
    juice, orange zest, orange juice, oil, Worcestershire sauce, cumin, salt, and pepper until smooth.
    <strong>Step 2</strong>
    Place steak in a large resealable bag and pour in marinade. Press air out of bag and massage marinade into steak.
    Refrigerate at least 4 hours or up to overnight.
    <strong>Step 3</strong>
    Prepare a grill for medium-high heat; heat 5 minutes (or preheat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat).
    Pour a small amount of oil onto a wad of paper towels and rub grates until coated with a thin layer of oil. Repeat
    if needed to make sure grates are coated.
    <strong>Step 4</strong>
    Using paper towels, pat excess marinade from steak; season both sides with a heavy pinch of salt and pepper.
    <strong>Step 5</strong>
    Grill steak until just browned on one side, about 3 minutes. Flip and continue to grill until second side is browned
    and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 125Â°, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer steak to a
    cutting board, tent with foil, and let rest 5 minutes.
    <strong>Step 6</strong>
    Meanwhile, reduce grill heat to medium and grill tortillas until just toasted, 20 to 30 seconds per side. Transfer
    tortillas to a platter.
    <strong>Step 7</strong>
    Slice steak against the grain into bite-sized pieces. Top each tortilla with steak, onion, cilantro, radishes,
    cotija, and salsa verde.
